## Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools group: 

1. Configuration-based tools like Terraform and Crossplane use low-code declarative formats such as YAML or HCL.

2. Scripting-based tools like Pulumi (with Python/TS) and CDK offer full programming capabilities for dynamic infrastructure.

3. Cloud-specific tools like AWS CloudFormation, Azure Bicep, and Google Deployment Manager are tightly coupled to their respective platforms.
