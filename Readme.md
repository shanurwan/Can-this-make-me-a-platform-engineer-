- Topic = Devops
- Personal rating = 8.5/10
- Comment = Very addictive and easy to digest. Most importantly directly real world applicable. He even guide on jira ticket and real world work structure, I feel like wanna replace his youtube as my internship. If you are someone with no mentor like me, this is your goldmine. I deduct 1.5 marks because of lack of responsiveness.
